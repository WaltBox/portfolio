            <p>
                Hello my name is Walt Boxwell. 
                I am a current student at The University of Texas at Austin, studying Human Dimensions of Organizations (HDO). 
                Growing up I have always wanted to learn how to code but have neveer really known where or how to start. 
                I finally decided to decided to take my first step and invest in myself which is why I have chosen to take the UT coding Bootcamp.
                 Because I am a student and a part-time employee at Prosperity Bank, I have had to adapt and implement new time management skills in order to be succesful in this course and in my education.
